### ðŸ†— Simple but powerful buttons!

Allright, let's start! First, we're going to import the base class of everything, the UIManager. This is the entry point that will manage the most important things of the UI in our app as it let us define, store, retrieve and change different layouts for the app based on the power of CSS Grid. Maybe in the future, this is going to be changed to a custom BIMApp component, like `<bim-app></bim-app>`.

```ts
import { UIManager } from "../../core/UIManager";
```
